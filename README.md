 This representation allows the programmer to use measures in arithmetic expressions as if they were numbers, but with the advantage of providing explicit information to the system, specifically, the measures units. See http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1094964 or http://stephane.ducasse.free.fr/Teaching/CoursAnnecy/0506-M1-COO/aconcagua-p292-wilkinson.pdf for more about this.
